## Officer Note Formatting Guide

The addon extracts race, faction, date joined, and timezone information from officer notes using a standardized format. This enables enhanced features in the Detailed View tab, Member Details panel, and Region filter.

### Complete Format

**Pattern:** `RACE-MMDDYYTTT`

- **RACE** = 1-2 letter race code followed by dash (-)
- **MMDDYY** = 6-digit date (Month/Day/Year)
- **TTT** = 3-letter timezone code

**Examples:** 
- `Or-030125PST` = Orc player who joined March 1st, 2025 in PST timezone
- `NE-121524EST` = Night Elf who joined December 15th, 2024 in EST timezone

### Supported Race Codes

Both single-letter and two-letter codes are supported for clarity:

**Alliance:**
- **NE-** or **N-** = Night Elf
- **Dw-** or **D-** = Dwarf
- **Hu-** or **H-** = Human
- **Gn-** or **G-** = Gnome
- **HE-** or **He-** = High Elf

**Horde:**
- **Or-** or **O-** = Orc
- **Tr-** or **T-** = Troll
- **Ta-** = Tauren
- **Un-** or **U-** = Undead
- **Go-** = Goblin

*Note: Codes are case-insensitive (e.g., HE-, He-, or he- all work)*

### Supported Timezone Codes

**Americas:**
- PST (UTC-8), PDT (UTC-7)
- MST (UTC-7), MDT (UTC-6)
- CST (UTC-6), CDT (UTC-5)
- EST (UTC-5), EDT (UTC-4)

**Oceania:**
- AEST (UTC+10) - Australian Eastern
- NZST (UTC+12) - New Zealand

**Europe:**
- GMT (UTC+0), UTC (UTC+0)
- CET (UTC+1), EET (UTC+2)

**Asia:**
- MSK (UTC+3) - Moscow
- IST (UTC+5:30) - India
- JST (UTC+9) - Japan

### Flexible Formatting

The addon supports partial formats - you can include only the information you want to track:

**Full Format:**
- `Or-030125PST` = Race + Date + Timezone
- `NE-121524EST` = Race + Date + Timezone

**Date + Timezone (no race):**
- `030125PST` = Joined March 1st, 2025 in PST

**Race + Date (no timezone):**
- `Hu-030125` = Human who joined March 1st, 2025

**Race + Timezone (no date):**
- `Dw-PST` = Dwarf player in PST timezone

**Timezone Only:**
- `PST` = Player in PST timezone (useful for alts)

**Race Only:**
- `Un-` = Undead player

### Additional Text

You can add any additional text after the formatted section:

- `Or-030125PST Main Tank` ✓
- `NE- 300 BS/300 LW` ✓
- `HE- Alt of Mainchar` ✓
- `Hu-PST Officer` ✓

The addon will extract the structured data and preserve all text in the officer note field.

### Officer Note Best Practices

1. **Use consistent formatting** across all members for easier management
2. **Main characters** should have full format: `RACE-MMDDYYTTT` (e.g., `Or-030125PST`)
3. **Alt characters** can use minimal format: `RACE-TTT` or just `RACE-` (e.g., `Un-EST` or `Dw-`)
4. **Timezone-only** works well for members who don't want to share join date
5. **Add rank/role info** after the formatted section: `NE-030125PST MT`
6. **Profession info** can be in public notes for crafter detection

### What Gets Displayed

**Guild Members Tab:**
- Race column (e.g., "Orc")
- Faction column (A/H with color)

**Detailed View Tab:**
- Date Joined column (e.g., "03/01/25" or "—")
- Time Zone column (e.g., "PST (UTC-8)" or "—")

**Member Details Panel:**
- Full member information including all extracted data
- Race shown in "Level: 60 Orc Warrior" format
- Faction icon (Alliance/Horde emblem)
- Date Joined and Time Zone as separate fields

**Region Filter:**
- Automatically maps timezone to region
- Filter members by: Americas, Oceania, Europe, Asia
